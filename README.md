# LocalGyrificationIndex

Cortical folding shape-adaptive local gyrification index.
Input: surface file & sulcal/gyral curves
Output: scalar local gyrification index map on the surface.

Requirement: MeshLib (general mesh processing and H-J PDE), SlicerExecutionModel (CLI), klaplace (outer hull correspondence), and FreeSurfer (voxelization of the surface)
